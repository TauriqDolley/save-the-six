# Save the Six

Save the Six is a static web-page for a District Six Museum fundraiser run by myself and a group of passionate indidvuals. After Covid19's effect on the tourism industry, a vital piece of South Africa's history is under threat of closing down and I wanted to use my skillset to assist in bringing support and attention to the museums plight. 

The website contains our Call-to-Action as well as a link to a styled Google Form that allows artists to submit artwork for auction. The proceeds of the auction will be donated to the museum. 

The goal of the site is to create an easily shareable mobile-friendly site that informs people quickly and provides easy ways to get involved. It is responsive for various screen sizes and is built using HTML5/ CSS / ES6 Javascript
