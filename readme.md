# Save the Six

Save the Six is a static web-page which consolidates information relating to the District Six Museum's fundraiser. After Covid19's effect on the tourism industry, a vital piece of South Africa's history is under threat of closing down. 

The goal of the site is to create an easily shareable mobile-friendly site that informs people quickly and provides easy ways to assist the museum. 

## Features

Embedded a curated Twitter timeline of related tweets as well as a widget that allows those unable to donate to tweet out.
